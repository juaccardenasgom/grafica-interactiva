      <h2 id="p1">Foundation</h2>

      <p>Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches. At some point in the tenth century, four of the greatest
        witches and wizards that ever lived founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their names were Godric
        Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. As The Sorting Hat told us, their reason
        for doing so was because they had the ‘selfsame yearning, to make the world’s best magic school’, and once they
        did, each created their own house to represent a personality and skill that they wanted to nurture. Gryffindor
        students embodied bravery and chivalry; Ravenclaw, intelligence and wit; Hufflepuff, loyalty and fair play; and
        Slytherin, the values of being sly and cunning.</p>

      <p>It was built in Scotland, away from Muggle eyes. The tenth century was a dangerous time for witches and
        wizards, who were being persecuted by Muggles hostile to magic. Therefore, Hogwarts was built somewhere in the
        Scottish Highlands, and concealed with numerous charms and spells to make it impossible for Muggles to trespass.
        For instead of an enormous school, any passing Muggle would only see ruins and signs warning them of danger.
      </p>

      <h2 id="p2">Construction</h2>

      <p>The castle itself was huge and complex. Hogwarts has a long history of ancient magic, and Albus Dumbledore
        admitted that not even he knew all of its secrets. Indeed, much about the design and construction of Hogwarts
        remains a mystery. Did the founders implement the Anti-Disapparition Jinx? Where did the Room of Requirement
        come from? Why did they build a school next to a dark and dangerous forest?</p>

      <h2 id="p3">Founders</h2>

      <p>The founders were friends, but fell out over what Hogwarts should be. Much like the Marauders, or Harry,
        Hermione and Ron, the founders of Hogwarts were originally friends. Yet that changed once it became clear that
        certain founders had a very different idea of what they wanted Hogwarts to be. That founder, of course, was
        Salazar Slytherin, who distrusted Muggle-born wizards, and believed that only ‘pure-blood’ students should be
        allowed to attend Hogwarts. The other founders disagreed – especially Godric Gryffindor, who was, up until then,
        Slytherin’s greatest friend. Their argument – possibly, it’s suggested, a duel – resulted in Slytherin leaving
        the school behind.</p>

      <h2 id="p4">Salazar Slytherin's Exit</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/slytherin.jpg" alt="Chamber of secrets">
        <figcaption>Chamber of secrets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Salazar Slytherin left, but not before he built the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that the hidden chamber
        was kept secret from the other founders, and was sealed until Slytherin’s ‘true heir’ arrived at the school: a
        student who would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the Basilisk inside, a huge snake that
        would purge the school of Muggle-born wizards. Now that is a grudge</p>

      <h2 id="p5">Ravenclaw's Tragedy</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/ravenclaw.jpg" alt="Rowena Ravenclaw's diagem">
        <figcaption>Rowena Ravenclaw's diagem</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Tragedy also followed Rowena Ravenclaw. Rowena Ravenclaw was the greatest witch of her time; a figure famed for
        her intelligence and wit – and that was before she wore her enchanted diadem, which was said to enhance the
        wisdom of the wearer. Such a witch casts a long shadow, one her daughter Helena found it difficult to escape
        from. Envying her mother’s status and power, she betrayed her by stealing the diadem – believing it could make
        her powerful – and ran away from Hogwarts. The betrayal embarrassed Rowena, who told no one, including her
        fellow founders, that the diadem was missing.</p>

      <p>On her death bed, she sent a young man to find Helena, so she could see her daughter for one last time. That
        young man, who had long been infatuated with Helena, tracked her down to a forest in Albania... but ending up
        killing her when she rejected his advances. His real name is unknown, but you’ll recognise him by his
        post-mortem moniker, the Bloody Baron.</p>

      <h2 id="p6">Gryffindor’s Legacy</h2>

      <p>Godric Gryffindor favoured the virtues of courage and heroism, and has been described by J.K. Rowling as ‘the
        best duellist of his time’ — both with a wand, and a sword. Thus his legacy lives on with the Sword of
        Gryffindor, the relic that Harry Potter used to destroy Horcruxes. But he also endures through another object.
        You see, when the founders became older, they were faced with a problem: how would they ensure that students
        were sorted into the right House after they were gone? For up until that point, that decision was made by them
        and them alone. The solution? Godric’s hat. The founders decided that the best course of action was for Godric
        to take off his hat so that all four of them could enchant it to sort students long after their deaths. And lo,
        the Sorting Hat was born.</p>
