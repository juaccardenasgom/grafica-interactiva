      <h1 id="top">Location</h1>

      <p>Hogwarts is located in the Highlands in the north of Scotland. The school is protected by numerous
        charms and spells that make it possible for a Muggle to locate. Instead, Muggles only see ruins with
        danger warnings.</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling" target="_blank">J. K.
            Rowling</a></b> says she visualises Hogwarts, in its entirety, to be:</p>

      <blockquote>
        A huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle, with a jumble of towers and battlements. Like the Weasleys' house,
        it isn't a building that Muggles could build, because it is supported by magic.
      </blockquote>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/castle.jpg" alt="Castle">
        <figcaption>Hogwarts Castle</caption>
      </figure>

      <p>The school is depicted as having <b>numerous charms and spells on and around it</b> that make it impossible for
        a Muggle to locate it. Muggles cannot see the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of
        danger. The castle's setting is described as having extensive grounds with sloping lawns, flowerbeds and
        vegetable patches, a loch (called The Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several
        greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch pitch. There is also an owlery, which houses all
        the owls owned by the school and those owned by students. Some rooms in the school tend to "move around", and so
        do the stairs in the grand staircase.</p>

      <h2 id="p1">Hiding place of the Philosopher's Stone</h2>

      <p>Accessed by entering a trapdoor in the forbidden corridor on the third floor, and protected by a gauntlet of
        seven magical challenges set up by the teachers.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/stone.png" alt="Hiding place of the Philosopher's Stone">
        <figcaption>Philosopher's Stone chamber</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>A giant three-headed dog named Fluffy placed specially to guard the trapdoor by Hagrid.</li>
        <li>Devil's Snare, grown by Professor Sprout.</li>
        <li>A room containing dozens of keys, charmed by Flitwick to sprout wings and fly near the ceiling. One of these
          keys will unlock the door to the next section. However, in the film adaptation, the keys attack the seeker of
          the Stone.</li>
        <li>A large chessboard with an army of large chessmen, transfigured by McGonagall. To continue to the door on
          the opposite side, the person in question must beat the chessmen at a game of wizards' chess where the player
          must risk his life if he loses. Ron and Professor Quirrell are the only wizards to win the game of wizards'
          chess.</li>
        <li>A room with a large troll inside. This is Quirrell's challenge. In the book, Quirrell had knocked out his
          own troll to get to the last room and thus the trio did not have to fight it; in the film, it does not appear,
          but it appears in the PS1 and Game Boy Color version of the game.</li>
        <li>A series of potions, brewed by Snape. A logical riddle, not magic, has to be solved. There are two doors,
          blocked by fire. One potion will allow the person to exit the way he or she arrived, another will allow him or
          her to continue to the next chamber, two are nettle wine, and the other three are poison. This challenge does
          not appear in the film, but does in the video game adaptation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="p2">Chamber of Secrets</h2>

      <p>The Chamber of Secrets, which is deep under the school (most likely under the lake), was home to an ancient
        Basilisk, intended to be used to purge the school of Muggle-born students. Salazar Slytherin, one of the
        founders of Hogwarts, built the Chamber before he left the school.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/chamber.jpg" alt="Chamber of Secrets">
        <figcaption>Chamber of Secrets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The entrance to the Chamber is hidden in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. One of the sink taps
        has a snake scratched into its side; when a command in Parseltongue is spoken, it opens to reveal the mouth of a
        dark, slimy chute, wide enough to slide down, that gives onto a stone tunnel. There are many skeletons of small
        animals littering the floor and even a gigantic skin shed by the Basilisk. The tunnel leads to a solid wall,
        carved with two entwined serpents with emeralds for eyes. At a command in Parseltongue, the wall opens to
        expose a long, dim corridor, lined with monumental statues of snakes, including two rows of towering stone
        pillars with more carved serpents that brace the ceiling. A colossal statue of Salazar Slytherin, looking
        ancient and monkey-like, is at the centre. The Basilisk rested inside the statue and emerged from its mouth when
        the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, summoned it.</p>

      <h2 id="p3">Room of Requirement</h2>

      <p>On the seventh floor opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy attempting to train trolls for
        the ballet, the Room of Requirement appears only when someone is in need of it. To make it appear, one must walk
        past its hidden entrance three times while concentrating on what is needed. The room will then appear, outfitted
        with whatever is required. To the Hogwarts house-elves, it is also known as the Come and Go Room.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/room.jpg" alt="Room of Requirement">
        <figcaption>Room of Requirement</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Harry learns of the room's abilities from Dobby in Order of the Phoenix, finding it the perfect location for
        his Dumbledore's Army meetings, during which it is filled with bookcases full of Defence Against the Dark Arts
        volumes, many different kinds of Dark Detectors, and a plethora of floor cushions for practising defensive
        spells. When the D.A. is betrayed, the room is left open, and Pansy Parkinson is able to retrieve the list of
        members of the organisation. In Half-Blood Prince Harry uses the Room of Hidden Things to stash his copy of
        Advanced Potion-Making, describing it as the size of a large cathedral and packed to overflowing with items
        hidden by Hogwarts inhabitants over the years, such as old potions, clothing, ruined furniture, an old tiara
        (which happens to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes), or books which are "no doubt banned or graffitied or
        stolen." He later realises that Draco has been using the room in this state to hide and repair the Vanishing
        Cabinet to use it to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Ironically, while Harry tries many times to get into
        the Room of Requirement to see what Draco is doing, the only time he succeeds to get into the room (and he is
        not thinking about Draco), he gains access to the room where Malfoy has been working.</p>

      <h2 id="p4">Forbidden Forest</h2>

      <p>The Forbidden Forest is a large, dark enchanted forest in the boundaries of the school grounds. It is usually
        referred to simply as "the Forest" and in the film series as the "Dark Forest". It is strictly forbidden to all
        students, except during Care of Magical Creatures lessons and, on rare occasions, detentions.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/forest.jpg" alt="Forbidden Forest">
        <figcaption>Forbidden Forest</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Among the plant species within the Forest are trees such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, yew and knotgrass and
        thorn undergrowth. Though the Forest is vastly dense and wild, there are a few paths and clearings. Hagrid, who
        frequently travels into the Forest for various reasons, mostly makes these trails. The Forest is also home to an
        assortment of creatures, many of them dangerous.</p>

      <h2 id="p5">Hogwarts Express</h2>

      <p>
        <b>The Hogwarts Express</b> is a train that carries students non-stop from Platform ​9 &frac34; at King's Cross
        station in
        London to Hogsmeade Station, near Hogwarts. Prefects of the school ride in a separate carriage near the front of
        the train. The compartments on the train appear to be lettered; in Half-Blood Prince, the "Slug Club" meets in
        compartment C.
