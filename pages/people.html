      <p>Here's some remarkable characters that have spent more of ther lifetime in this castle. Take a good look
        because some of them are really good at witchcraft and witchery. And don't fool yourself, every one of these
        people is quite the character!</p>

      <h2 id="p1">Albus Dumbledore</h2>

      <p>Rowling has stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he "is the epitome of goodness." She said that
        Dumbledore speaks for her, as he "knows pretty much everything" about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling
        mentioned that Dumbledore regrets "that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of
        knowing. And he would rather not know." As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, "Dumbledore is a very
        wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming
        in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly
        permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she
        imagined Dumbledore "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and – and quite stately." During his
        time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about
        150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or
        116 at the time of his death.</p>

      <h2 id="p2">Severus Snape</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/snape.png" alt="Severus Snape">
        <figcaption>Severus Snape</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In an interview, Rowling described Snape's character as an "antihero". She has said that she drew
        inspiration for Snape's character from a disliked teacher from her own childhood, and described Snape as a
        horrible teacher, saying the "worst, shabbiest thing you can do as a teacher is to bully students."
        However, she does suggest in the books that he is generally an effective teacher. Although Rowling has said
        that Gilderoy Lockhart is her only character that she "deliberately based on a real person", Snape was
        reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as
        an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow. Rowling based Snape's given name on "Severus Road" in
        Clapham, and his surname is borrowed from the name of a village in England. In a 1999 interview and
        again in 2004, Rowling singled out Snape as one of her favourite characters to write.</p>

      <h2 id="p3">Rubeus Hagrid</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/hagrid.jpg" alt="Rubeus Hagrid">
        <figcaption>Rubeus Hagrid</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Hagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created on "the very first day". She has explained the
        source of his name as "another old English word, meaning – if you were hagrid – it’s a dialect word – you’d had
        a bad night. Hagrid is a big drinker – he has a lot of bad nights." His first name, Rubeus, was named after red
        in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his "passion" to Dumbledore's
        "asceticism". In her article "Harry’s Fame", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on
        Rowling’s work, and Hagrid is the only character that is "directly drawn from the Forest of Dean". According to
        Goring, Hagrid’s "dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality." She also claims that Hagrid is physically
        "modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who’d swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of
        leather and hair".</p>

      <h2 id="p4">Harry Potter</h2>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>Harry Potter</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>According to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting
        for a delayed train from Manchester, England to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of "this scrawny,
        black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me". While
        developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school
        called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with The Guardian: "Harry had to be an orphan—so that he's a
        free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them ... Hogwarts has to be a boarding
        school—half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces
        my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry."</p>

      <h2 id="p5">Hermione Granger</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/hermione.png" alt="Hermione Granger">

      </figure>

      <p>Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born Gryffindor, who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron
        Weasley. J.K. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979 and she was nearly twelve when she first
        attended Hogwarts. She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by J.K. Rowling as a "very
        logical, upright and good" character. J.K. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a
        bit bemused by their odd daughter but "very proud of her all the same." They are well aware of the wizarding
        world and have visited Diagon Alley with her. Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned
        sibling did not make an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it "seemed too late"
        to introduce the character after all of that. Rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that Hermione is an only
        child.</p>

      <h2 id="p6">Ron Weasley</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/ron.jpg" alt="Ron Weasley">
        <figcaption>Ron Weasley</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>According to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created "the very first day." Ron is inspired by
        Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is dedicated), but she has
        clearly stated that she "never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase." Like
        Harris is to Rowling, Ron is "always there" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of
        the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry
        possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery and magical ability
        several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, entering into the Forbidden Forest
        with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia, producing a full-corpreal Patronus Charm in the
        fifth book and even, in the seventh book, getting basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets by mimicking
        Parseltongue without understanding it.</p>
